# **MoC prices source**

This is the python package used in [**Money on Chain**](https://moneyonchain.com/) projects where it is required to get the coinpair values directly from the sources.
This package includes a CLI tool that allows you to query the coinpair values in the same way that [**Money on Chain**](https://moneyonchain.com/) projects do.

The entry point for the documentation is [here](../README.md)
